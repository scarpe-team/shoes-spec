----------- app code
Shoes.app do
  @push = button "Push me"
  @push.click {
    alert "Aha! Click!"
  }
end

----------- test code
btn = button("@push")

# Button should exist with correct text
assert_equal "Push me", btn.text

# Click triggers alert - we can't easily test the alert dialog itself,
# but we can verify the button exists and is clickable
btn.trigger_click

# If we got here without error, the click handler ran
assert true, "Button click handler executed"
