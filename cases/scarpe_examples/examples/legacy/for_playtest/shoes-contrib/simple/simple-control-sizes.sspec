----------- test code
# Tests various control sizing options against a grid
# Demonstrates button, edit_line, list_box, progress, edit_box
# With standard and custom margin/height settings
#
# Fixed window: 360x600
# Grid lines for visual size verification

# Verify standard controls exist (multiple buttons)
btns = buttons()
assert btns.length >= 2, "Should have multiple buttons"
assert_equal "Standard", btns.first.text

# Verify edit_line exists with expected text
# Note: Multiple edit_lines - first should have "Standard"

# This is primarily a visual layout test
# Full verification would require measuring actual widget dimensions
assert true, "Control sizing demo rendered"
