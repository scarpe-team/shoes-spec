----------- app code
Shoes.app do
   button "Red Shoes" do
     image "http://shoesrb.com/img/shoes-icon.png"
   end

----------- test code
# TODO: This test needs real assertions!
# The app runs, but we need to verify behavior.
#
# Example assertions:
#   assert_equal "expected", para().text
#   button().trigger_click
#   assert_equal "after click", para().text
#
# For now, this is a placeholder that will SKIP:
