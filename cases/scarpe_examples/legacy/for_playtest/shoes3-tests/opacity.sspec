----------- app code
Shoes.app do
  stack do
    para "Click the button to reduce opacity to %90"
    button "reduce" do
     app.opacity =  0.90
     para "Opacity is #{app.opacity}\n"
    end
    button "normal" do
     app.opacity = 1.0
     para "normal\n"
    end
  end
end

----------- test code
# TODO: This test needs real assertions!
# The app runs, but we need to verify behavior.
#
# Example assertions:
#   assert_equal "expected", para().text
#   button().trigger_click
#   assert_equal "after click", para().text
#
# For now, this is a placeholder that will SKIP:
skip "TODO: Add assertions for opacity"
