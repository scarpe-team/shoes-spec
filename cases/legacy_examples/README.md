# Legacy Shoes Applications

These are Shoes examples, taken from a wide variety of sources. In general, we try not to modify them.

Shoes-Spec originated with Scarpe, so no pre-Scarpe legacy applications have test code, only .rb Shoes apps.

## Pass Rate

What % of these are passing is going to drift in odd ways over time. We would like to add more test code
to check functionality. But of course, adding test code will result in more failures, including for
display services that had previously been passing.
