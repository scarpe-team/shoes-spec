# Tests from Shoes3

Not all of these will pass with Scarpe. We don't have the same drawables.
Some fairly significant differences happened in Ruby since 2009-2012.
In some cases we don't want to use or duplicate their test infrastructure
(e.g. Minitest.)

Despite these being in some sense legacy, there's a lot more code that's
fine to modify here. This was test code. Some of it may still be helpful
to us, but often it will need modifying.
